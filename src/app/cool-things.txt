There are few things that you needed like a http, resolver and a sanitizer. here's a link to that explaining how to implement it from scratch.

So for example you have a request then transforming the returned blob into a safe style for us to able to use it in our style directive

this.http.get('assets/img/bg.jpg', { responseType: 'blob' }).pipe(
  map( image => {
    const blob: Blob = new Blob([image], { type: 'image/jpeg' });
    const imageStyle = `url(${window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)})`;
    return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustStyle(imageStyle);
  })
)
